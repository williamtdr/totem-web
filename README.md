## About Totem
Totem is a music sharing platform. Users join rooms where they can take turns queueing songs for each other. Totem supports moderator tools and customization, with a focus on simplicity and accessible design.

## Current Developers
[williamtdr] (http://github.com/williamtdr), [dcv] (http://github.com/dcvslab), and [pogodaanton] (http://github.com/pogodaanton)

## Environment
We recommend using apache or nginx on your local machine and gulp to build the project. See gulpfile.js for specific configuration, run npm install in the project's root directory to install gulp and its dependencies. If you'd rather not set up a production environment, you can use index.dev.html to test (although updating it is secondary to the main site).

## Contact
We have a slack team for developers and community. To join contact an existing member, such as one of the people listed above.
